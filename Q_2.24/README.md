# Tracing System Calls using Strace

## Requirements
- Linux Based Kernel (for strace)
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)


For an Installation Guide, kindly refer the [References](https://github.com/DevAgrawal04/OperatingSystems_Assignment_CS252/tree/main/Q_2.24##References).

## Compiling the File

To compile the file, run the following command:
>  gcc -o copy_code copy_code.c

Here, copy_code is the name of the object file given by us, and copy_code.c is the file we're trying to compile.

## Using Strace

Note: Strace works only on Linux Based Terminals, for installation guides kindly refer the [References](https://github.com/DevAgrawal04/OperatingSystems_Assignment_CS252/edit/main/Q_2.24/README.md#references)

We use strace as follows:
> strace ./copy_code

It'll output all of the system calls onto the terminal

To store this raw terminal output we can use the command:
> strace -o log_raw.txt ./copy_code

The raw log terminal will now be saved as [log_raw.txt](https://github.com/DevAgrawal04/OperatingSystems_Assignment_CS252/blob/main/Q_2.24/log_raw.txt)

Strace can also output the count number of system calls:
>strace -c ./copy_code

Now we can export this terminal output to a file as follows:
> strace -o log_table.txt -c ./copy_code

This saves our tabular terminal output to a file named [log_table.txt](https://github.com/DevAgrawal04/OperatingSystems_Assignment_CS252/blob/main/Q_2.24/log_table.txt)
